            <br>
            <p>The fascinating history, iconic models and tours of the production lines inside the Automobili 
              Lamborghini Museum reveal 60 years of innovation that are projecting Lamborghini into the future.
              <br>From the first visionary creations of the genius of 
              Ferruccio Lamborghini, such as the Miura and the Countach, 
              followed by the more recent and exclusive super sports cars
              like the Hurac√°n Performante, the Aventador SVJ, and the 
              few-offs Centenario, Sesto Elemento and Veneno, to arrive 
              today with the first Lamborghinis with hybrid technology, 
              the Sian and Countach LPI 800-4.
              <br>The Automobili Lamborghini Museum offers an interactive
              experience, also provided by the new driving simulator 
              that amplifies the emotions and discovery of the vehicles 
              on display.
